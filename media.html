    </div>   
<p><b>My Semester in Web Design has been surprising. When I first decided to take this class I was just taking it for the credits. 
    The first few weeks were a little confusing. This was the first class I've taken that has anything to do with web design and coding. The only previous knowledge I had of coding was the trial and error process of editing my tumblr page in 2012. 
    The first couple of FreeCodeCamp assignment felt tedious and painful but once the coding clicked in my head; it really clicked. </b></p>
<p><b> This class introduced me to a creative outlet. 
I loved each assignment we did this semester and I'm so glad I took this class because I thinks web design is a very useful skill to have.</b></p>
